# Cows-and-bulls-game
# Hi! This is my first ever coding project
# My project is Cows and Bulls Game
# The game is basically a number guessing game
# If you guess a digit correctly which is in the
# hidden number but not at the same place you get 1 C
# and if it is at the right place too you get 1 B
# Your aim is to get 4 Bs
# The libraries used here are: Random, tkinter
#
