# Cows-and-bulls-game
> Number-guessing game based in python

Hi! This is my first ever coding project.
My project is Cows and Bulls Game.
The game is basically a number guessing game.
If you guess a digit correctly which is in the
hidden number but not at the same place you get 1 C
and if it is at the right place too you get 1 B.
Your aim is to get 4 Bs.

## Installation
Requires Python 3.8+ with Tkinter and Random libraries installed
```shell
pip install tk
```
This installs Tkinter into your local machine
```shell
python game_screen.py
```
This runs the game.
